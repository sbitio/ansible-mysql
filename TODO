* Allow to change root password after first run.
* Create a mysql_cnf_file action plugin to allow for a mechanism to provide conf.d settings files.
* Provide a role variable to feed mysql_cnf_file in config.yml (similar to 'services' in corosync).

Example:

```yaml
mysql_cnf_file:
args:
  name: 
  priority: 20 by default
  section: client|mysqld_safe|mysqld|mysqldump|mysql|isamchk
  settings: key/value or a blob of text?
```
